# Final Preparation Part1
Objective: 


*   Lecture1: Data Type
*   Lecture2: String, List
*   Lecture3: If-Else
*   Lecture4: Loop

**Question 1** (3.5 marks). Write a program in which you need to remove the duplicate numbers from a list, which can be pre-defined. The list shown in the image below is just an example. Your output should be displayed in descending order as follows:
a = [1,9,2,3,4,5,5,3,2,4,6,1,9,9,3]
output = [9,6,5,4,3,2,1]
"""

#Q1 Write your program here.
a = [1,9,2,3,4,5,5,3,2,4,6,1,9,9,3]
out = []
for i in a :
  if i not in out :
    out.append(i)
print(sorted(out)[::-1])

"""**Question 2** (3.5 Marks): Write a program in which you need to display the current numbers, previous numbers, and the sum values (the current number + the previous number) as shown in the image below. The current number should start from 1 while the previous number is 0. In this iteration, your current number should not exceed 9. 
Printing current and previous numbers and their sum in a range of 9
Current Number 1 Previous Number 0 Sum: 1
Current Number 2 Previous Number 1 Sum: 3
Current Number 3 Previous Number 2 Sum: 5
Current Number 4 Previous Number 3 Sum: 7
Current Number 5 Previous Number 4 Sum: 9
Current Number 6 Previous Number 5 Sum: 11
Current Number 7 Previous Number 6 Sum: 13
Current Number 8 Previous Number 7 Sum: 15
Current Number 9 Previous Number 8 Sum: 17
"""

#Q2 Write your program here.
print("Printing current and previous numbers and their sum in a range of 9")
sum = 0
num = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for i in range(1,len(num)) :
  sum = num[i] + num[i-1]
  print("Current Number " + str(num[i]) + " Previous Number " + str(num[i-1]) + " Sum: " + str(sum))

"""**Question 3** (3 marks): Write a program in which you need to print ASCII characters according to the pattern shown in the image below. The userâ€™s input number (e.g., 10) will decide how many lines you should print in your output. In this program, it should be noted that the output should start with  character A (65 in ASCII), and it is incremental (e.g., B=66, C=67). (Hint: to change from an ASCII code to a character, you may need to use chr(num) in your code). Also, you should note that when you display more than one character in the output, there should have a space between two characters (e.g., B(space)B).
Enter a number...:10
A
B B
C C C
D D D D
E E E E E
F F F F F F
G G G G G G G
H H H H H H H H
I I I I I I I I I
J J J J J J J J J J

#Q3 Write your program here.

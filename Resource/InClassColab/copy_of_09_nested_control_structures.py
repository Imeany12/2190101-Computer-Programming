* List comprehension

##Exercise 9-1.1: Write a program to accept an integer ```N``` to display the multiplicaiton table from base 2 to ```N```, where the multiplier (column) is running from 1 to 5.

Feel free to use the function ```left_pad``` provided below, but otherwise use only the ``while`` structure(s) (NOT ```for```).
